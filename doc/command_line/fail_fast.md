# CLI: `--fail-fast` option

Kaocha by default runs all tests it can find, providing a final summary on
  failures and errors when all tests have finished. With the `--fail-fast`
  option the test run will be interrupted as soon as a single failure or error
  has occured. Afterwards a summary of the test run so far is printed.

## Failing fast

- <em>Given </em> a file named "test/my/project/fail_fast_test.clj" with:

``` clojure
(ns my.project.fail-fast-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]))

(deftest test-1
  (is true))

(deftest test-2
  (is true)
  (is false)
  (is true))

(deftest test-3
  (is true))
```


- <em>When </em> I run `bin/kaocha --fail-fast`

- <em>Then </em> the exit-code should be 1

- <em>And </em> the output should contain:

``` nil
[(..F)]

FAIL in my.project.fail-fast-test/test-2 (fail_fast_test.clj:9)
expected: false
  actual: false
2 tests, 3 assertions, 1 failures.
```
